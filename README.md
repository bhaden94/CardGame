# CardGame
Program to simulate a classic card game known as War with some extra user interaction.

See the rules document for more information on the game.

The most recent update fix a few errors and added the user interaction. 

Next update will include pulling from the dicard pile if the players hand runs out of cards while in the
itsWar method. 

An error still exists that happens when itsWar is called two times in a row and the player does not have
enought cards in their hand or the discard pile to play.
